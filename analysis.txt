###  Score Ranges and Insights

| Score Range | Number of Wallets | Behavior Insight |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 0–100       | Few                | Very risky wallets with liquidations or no repayments |
| 100–200     | Few                | High borrow/low repay or idle behavior |
| 300–400     | Moderate           | Base score only, little to no activity |
| 400–500     | Most wallets       | Deposits only or some limited interactions |
| 600–800     | Few                | Good repayment behavior with no liquidations |
| 900–1000    | Rare               | Excellent wallets with consistent repayments and no risky actions |
